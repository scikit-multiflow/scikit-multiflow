class ADWIN(BaseDriftDetector):
    """ Adaptive Windowing method for concept drift detection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    delta : float (default=0.002)
        The delta parameter for the ADWIN algorithm.

    Notes
    -----
    ADWIN [1]_ (ADaptive WINdowing) is an adaptive sliding window
    algorithm for detecting change and keeping updated statistics about
    a data stream. ADWIN allows algorithms not adapted for drifting
    data to be resistant to this phenomenon.

    The general idea is to keep statistics from a window of variable
    size while detecting concept drift.

    The algorithm will decide the size of the window by cutting
    the statistics' window at different points and analysing
    the average of some statistic over these two windows. If
    the absolute value of the difference between the two averages
    surpasses a pre-defined threshold, change is detected at that point
    and all data before that time is discarded.
