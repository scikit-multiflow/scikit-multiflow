    Notes
    -----
    EDDM (Early Drift Detection Method) [1]_ aims to improve the
    detection rate of gradual concept drift in DDM, while keeping
    a good performance against abrupt concept drift.

    This method works by keeping track of the average distance
    between two errors instead of only the error rate. For this,
    it is necessary to keep track of the running average distance
    and the running standard deviation, as well as the maximum
    distance and the maximum standard deviation.

    The algorithm works similarly to the DDM algorithm, by keeping
    track of statistics only. It works with the running average
    distance (`pi'`) and the running standard deviation (`si'`), as
    well as `p'max` and `s'max`, which are the values of `pi'` and `si'`
    when `(pi' + 2 * si')` reaches its maximum.

    Like DDM, there are two threshold values that define the
    borderline between no change, warning zone, and drift detected.
    These are as follows:

    * if `(pi' + 2 * si')/(p'max + 2 * s'max)` < `alpha` -> Warning zone
    * if `(pi' + 2 * si')/(p'max + 2 * s'max)` < `beta` -> Change detected

    `alpha` and `beta` are set to 0.95 and 0.9, respectively.
