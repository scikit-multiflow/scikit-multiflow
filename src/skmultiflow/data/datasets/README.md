This directory contains some datasets for basic testing and demos.

* **Moving Squares Dataset** (moving_squares.csv)

  Type: Multi-class classification
  > Losing, V., Hammer, B. and Wersing, H., 2016, December. Knn classifier with self adjusting memory for heterogeneous concept drift. In Data Mining (ICDM), 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on (pp. 291-300). IEEE.

* **Music Dataset** (music.csv)

  Type: Multi-label classification

*Note:* SEA datasets were created using the SEAGenerator. The recommended approach is to use the `SEAGenerator` directly.

Multi-target regression datasets contained in the 'mtr' folder:

* **scm1d and scm20d Datasets** (scm1d.csv, scm20.csv)

  Type: Multi-target regression
