Installation
============

**Note:** ``scikit-multiflow`` works with Python 3 **only**.

``scikit-multiflow`` requires ``numpy`` to be already installed in your system. There are multiple ways to install numpy,
for example, through ``pip``::

  $ pip install -U numpy

Once ``numpy`` is installed we can proceed with the installation. The easiest way to install ``scikit-multiflow`` and
its dependencies is ``pip``. Run the following command in the local path where you placed ``scikit-multiflow``::

  $ pip install -U .
